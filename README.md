### Clustering Exercises

This repository contains a collection of small clustering projects. Each project focuses on the following steps:

* Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing datasets for analysis.
* Dimensionality Reduction with PCA: Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to determine the optimal number of components for better clustering performance.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigating relationships and visualizing data to gain insights into the clustering process.
* Modeling: Applying various clustering algorithms to the data, including K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.

These projects aim to explore different aspects of clustering, from dimensionality reduction to detailed performance analysis with various clustering techniques.
